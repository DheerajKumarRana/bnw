In a glittering evening curated with precision and flair, FashionTV Acacia by BNW Developments has made its official debut before an elite audience of investors, global partners, dignitaries, and industry decision-makers. Hosted by the iconic Ania J, globally known as the "Voice of FashionTV," the evening was a celebration of vision, innovation, and the evolution of branded real estate.

A culmination of BNW's design-first ethos and FashionTV's global lifestyle influence, FashionTV Acacia is a high-concept residential project rising on the shores of Al Marjan Island in Ras Al Khaimah, a destination fast emerging as the UAE's most promising frontier for tourism, foreign investment, and luxury development. With its striking architecture, panoramic sea views, and immersive design language, the project embodies a bold rethinking urban living where fashion, functionality, and future-readiness converge.

Ankur Aggarwal, chairman and founder of BNW Developments, shared his perspective on the collaboration: "In an age where consumers are no longer just investing in space but in identity and experiential value, FashionTV Acacia presents a distinctive proposition. This is a carefully designed confluence of global culture, regional ambition, and the language of lifestyle. At BNW, we have always believed in creating meaningful intersections between established industries and transformational real estate. Following our successful foray into heritage-led luxury through our collaboration with IHCL for Taj Wellington Mews, it was essential to explore a completely different dimension this time, one rooted in contemporary culture and aspirational living. FashionTV, with its unparalleled global resonance, offered just that."

Vivek Anand Oberoi, managing director and co-founder of BNW Developments, added a thoughtful layer to the partnership: "FashionTV Acacia was never about aesthetic indulgence alone. It's about capturing a cultural pulse, the global shift toward curated spaces that reflect individual identity. We see the home as an extension of expression. With this collaboration, we have translated the ethos of FashionTV… its editorial sharpness, its contemporary rhythm into an architectural experience. It's not a project we launched, but a philosophy we built."
