**Dubai, UAE, 14 January 2026**: Following the resounding success of its inaugural season, BNW Developments proudly announces the return of the BNW Legends Cup 2.0, firmly established as one of the UAE’s most prestigious corporate cricket tournaments for the real estate fraternity.

The second edition officially commenced on 10 January at The Sevens Stadium, Dubai, with Indian cricket icon Virender Sehwag gracing the opening match, bringing unmistakable star power and excitement to the tournament.

Running until mid-February, BNW Legends Cup 2.0 features 48 highly competitive teams, including two home teams, BNW Mavericks and BNW Icons. The new season raises the bar with a brand-new car, and a prestigious championship trophy, reinforcing BNW’s commitment to creating a truly iconic sporting platform for the UAE’s real estate community.

After successfully uniting the region’s leading brokerage houses under one sporting banner in its debut season, the tournament returns with greater scale, heightened energy, and stronger camaraderie. Under the leadership of BNW Sports Director S. Sreesanth, Former Indian Cricketer, the Legends Cup once again celebrates teamwork, resilience, and excellence both on and off the pitch.

**Ankur Aggarwal, Chairman and Founder of BNW Developments**, said, “Growing up in India, cricket was never just a game; it was where we learned to dream, on the streets, driven by passion, teamwork, and resilience. With the BNW Legends Cup 2.0, our vision is to bring that same spirit of camaraderie to the UAE’s real estate community, uniting professionals beyond titles and competition.”

**Dr. Vivek Anand Oberoi, Managing Director and Co-Founder of BNW Developments**, added, “Cricket has been a lifelong passion for me, and the BNW Legends Cup is deeply personal. It mirrors our industry perfectly. On the field, players compete fiercely for every run. Off the field, they collaborate with the same intensity to close the next big deal. This tournament is about building bonds that go beyond the boundary rope.”

**S. Sreesanth, Sports Director at BNW Developments**, commented, “Cricket has been my guide, my discipline, and my emotional anchor through every phase of life. The BNW Legends Cup brings that spirit to life. Watching players compete for pride and brotherhood rather than contracts is a reminder of why this sport will always feel like home.”

The inaugural edition of the BNW Legends Cup delivered a thrilling debut season and welcomed international cricket legends including Chris Gayle, S. Sreesanth, and Shikhar Dhawan, whose presence elevated the tournament and inspired participants across the league.
