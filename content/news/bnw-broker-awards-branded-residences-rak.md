**Dubai, UAE, 17 February 2026** - BNW Developments hosted the BNW Broker Awards, recognising outstanding brokerage partners whose performance has played a pivotal role in the company’s continued growth across Ras Al Khaimah. In a first-of-its-kind moment for the region, BNW Developments went beyond traditional recognition to celebrate the unwavering drive of its channel partners, rewarding its top-performing brokers Patriot Real Estate and Fourth Home Real Estate with branded residences in Ras Al Khaimah. Many others were presented with limited edition Rolex watches; turning achievement into something truly lasting.

The event marked a moment of appreciation and reflection after a period of significant sales traction, reinforcing BNW’s position as the single largest private developer operating in Ras Al Khaimah. Top-performing brokers were recognised across multiple categories, celebrating both volume-driven success and long-term partnership.

With a rapidly expanding footprint in Ras Al Khaimah, BNW Developments today oversees multiple projects across the emirate, spanning residential, hospitality, and mixed-use destinations. The developer’s portfolio represents both scale and confidence in RAK’s evolving investment landscape. Recent sales performance across BNW projects has highlighted sustained buyer demand, driven by competitive pricing, international brand partnerships, and the emirate’s rising global profile.

**Dr. (CA) Ankur Aggarwal, Chairman and Founder of BNW Developments** said, “Our broker community is not an extended network to BNW. It is a foundational force behind our growth. I have always believed that failing to recognise exceptional performance is a greater loss than the achievement itself, because appreciation sustains trust and fuels ambition. The Broker Awards night has not simply been a celebration, but a personal acknowledgement of the relationships, conviction, and resilience that have carried our vision forward. At BNW Developments, partnerships are built on earned trust, and it is only right that we honour those who translate vision into results, day after day.”

**Dr. Vivek Anand Oberoi, Managing Director and Co-Founder, BNW Developments**, added, “Growth at this scale is never achieved alone. Our broker partners are central to how our developments reach the market and how trust is built with investors. These awards are our way of recognising the discipline, resilience, and ambition that continue to drive strong results.”

The BNW Broker Awards form part of the developer’s wider broker-first strategy, focused on transparency, collaboration, and long-term alignment. Beyond transactions, BNW has consistently invested in relationship-building initiatives that support brokers with access, insights, and shared growth opportunities.

As Ras Al Khaimah accelerates its transformation into a regional hub for tourism, business, and lifestyle-led living, BNW Developments continues to play a defining role in its growth and investment narrative. The Broker Awards stand as both a celebration of recent achievements and a forward-looking commitment to partnership-led success.
