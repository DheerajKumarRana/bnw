Nora Fatehi the Dilbar star will officially inaugurate the new Bricks and Woods office on Thursday, February 17, which will be housed in Business Bay's tallest structure, Ubora Tower. The new office spreads over 7000 sq. ft and has a breath-taking 360-degree view of the Dubai Skyline. This office will be BNW's additional workspace, other than offices in Dubai, New Delhi (India), London (UK) and Canada.

This new office is the first of several significant successes for BNW in 2022"...
