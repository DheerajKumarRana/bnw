**Dubai, UAE, 14 January, 2026: Radisson Hotel Group**, in partnership with BNW Developments, has announced the signing of Radisson Blu Hotel, RAK Central and Radisson Blu Residences, RAK Central, a landmark mixed-use hospitality project in Ras Al Khaimah set to open in 2029. The signing introduces a new Radisson Blu address to a fast-evolving part of the UAE, expanding the Group’s footprint in Ras Al Khaimah.

Set within RAK Central, a large-scale mixed-use destination planned as a future financial hub for the emirate, the project will sit at the heart of a 3.1 million sq. ft. master development integrating commercial, financial, residential, and recreational spaces. The site is strategically located close to Al Marjan Island and Al Hamra Village, with direct connectivity to the E11 highway, the UAE’s longest road linking Ras Al Khaimah to the other emirates, and convenient access to the emirate’s key resorts and visitor attractions.

"Our first RAK Central project announcement in collaboration with Radisson Hotel Group is a strategic milestone for BNW Developments. RAK Central is set to become the heartbeat of Ras Al Khaimah, and we are proud to be part of its transformation with a project of this scale,” said Ankur Aggarwal, Chairman and Founder of BNW Developments. “By integrating high-end residences with a flagship hotel, we are offering investors and residents an asset class that is commercially resilient and internationally coveted. We are focused on delivering a development that sets a new benchmark for branded living in the UAE.”

**Dr. Vivek Anand Oberoi, Managing Director and Co-Founder of BNW Developments**, added: “At BNW Developments, we do not merely build structures; we curate lifestyles that shatter the boundaries of the ordinary and redefine the very essence of the living experience. Bringing the prestigious Radisson Blu brand to RAK Central is a bold declaration of our pursuit of excellence and our unwavering conviction that Ras Al Khaimah is destined for global supremacy. This project is the ultimate synergy of iconic, soul-stirring design and world-class service, forging a sanctuary where the pulse of business meets the pinnacle of luxury in the beating heart of the emirate's new financial frontier."

“This signing reflects our ambition as we continue to grow our hotel and branded residential offering in the region and particularly in high-potential destinations across the UAE, and Ras Al Khaimah continues to stand out with its strong infrastructure pipeline, investment momentum, and expanding mix of demand drivers,” said **Elie Milky, Chief Development Officer, Middle East, NE Africa, Cyprus & Greece, Radisson Hotel Group**. “I am especially grateful to BNW Developments as we mark the start of this new venture together.”

Radisson Blu Hotel, RAK Central will feature 361 keys in a newly built hotel positioned above retail and cinema offerings, creating a vibrant day-to-night environment and strong destination appeal. The hotel will deliver extensive facilities designed for both business and leisure travelers, including five food and beverage outlets, a rooftop terrace and pool bar, meeting and events spaces, a spa and gym, a Business Class lounge, and a kid's club.

Adjacent to the hotel, Radisson Blu Residences, RAK Central will comprise 222 branded residences; residents will benefit from dedicated services delivered from the hotel, creating operational efficiencies and guest experience consistency, alongside food and beverage synergies across the wider development.

Radisson Blu is Radisson Hotel Group’s upper upscale brand, known for stylish spaces, a contemporary design approach, and the brand’s signature “Yes I Can!” service philosophy. The new signing strengthens Radisson Hotel Group’s portfolio in the UAE and supports its continued focus on strategically located, commercially resilient assets that can capture multiple demand segments, from corporate and MICE to leisure and longer stays.

Branded residences are among the fastest-growing segments of real estate, especially in the Gulf, as buyers and investors seek homes that combine everyday comfort with the assurance of a trusted hospitality brand. Professionally managed services, consistent standards, and access to hotel-style amenities are increasingly seen as key differentiators in major urban markets.

Radisson Hotel Group currently has over 100 hotels in operation and under development in the Middle East. This signing reinforces the Group’s commitment to the region and to diversifying its offering across hotels, resorts, and branded residences.
