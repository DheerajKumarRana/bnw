**Dubai, UAE, 27 January 2026** - BNW Developments - the single largest private developer in Ras Al Khaimah—has officially inaugurated its first luxury Sales Gallery and Experience Centre in the heart of the Emirate. This state-of-the-art flagship will serve as the nexus for the firm’s rapidly expanding portfolio, offering an immersive environment where architectural precision meets bespoke investor services.

The gallery was unveiled during an exclusive ceremony, marking a pivotal expansion in the firm’s mission to deliver ultra-luxurious and high-performance projects. The event was graced by H.H. Shaikh Arahmah Saoud Khalid Humaid Al Qasimi and drew the crème de la crème of the real estate world, who came to preview the future of luxury living in Ras Al Khaimah.

Framed by a stunning panoramic beach view, the gallery offers a strategic vantage point where guests can look out directly onto the horizon-shifting construction sites, witnessing the rapid, real-time evolution of BNW’s landmark developments.

**Dr. (CA) Ankur Aggarwal, Chairman and Founder of BNW Developments**, said, “Anchored by integrity and a vision for transformative progress, today marks a new chapter for BNW. This sales gallery and experience centre is the physical expression of our engineering brilliance, offering a window into the future of urban living. Here, our investors have a permanent home to witness the precision and absolute quality that define every square foot of our journey together.”

**Dr. Vivek Anand Oberoi, Managing Director and Co-Founder of BNW Developments**, added, “Real estate is fundamentally about human aspiration. With the launch of this gallery, we are bridging the gap between imaginative design and tangible reality. This is where our clients’ legacies begin. We have curated an environment that reflects the future of the Ras Al Khaimah—one that is bold, limitless, and deeply rooted in creating enduring value for a global audience.”
